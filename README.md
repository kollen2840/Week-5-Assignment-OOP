# Week-5-Assignment-OOP
this repository contains two major python scripts that are all oop programs. 

the first file which I names it as cultures, takes inspiration from a famous tv show known as the Orville. the tv show is science fictional drama that portrays a possibility of many lifeforms and cultures, through these cultural differences I aim at try to have a little oop program that will summarize for me at least the major difference. 

the second script file named as transport.py gives a little details about what modes of transport for different kind of animals and vehicles, and what fuels do they use if any.
